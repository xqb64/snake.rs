# snake

![build status](https://github.com/xvm32/snake/workflows/build/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/xvm32/snake/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=PGXYCNZL49)](https://codecov.io/gh/xvm32/snake)

This is a snake game I made to explore Rust a bit.

## Installation and playing

![screenshot](snake.gif)

* It looks better in real life than on this asciicast, I promise.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/xvm32/snake.git
```

Then run:

```
snake
```

## Development

You will need curses libraries:

```
sudo apt install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
```

Fork the repository, and make a PR.
